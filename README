Hi there,

- There are multiple jupyter notebooks for your convenience.
- You just can do "rull all cells" to view the outputs which are presented in the report.
- Or you can just run the codes normally using "python filename"
- The names of the notebooks and python files tell which algorithm is inspected for the datasets.
- For titanic, loan datasets - we have dropped "loanID" and "name" while preprocessing data.

PS : Some results may vary due to randomness involved in generating stratified k-folds for the models.
